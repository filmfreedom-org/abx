The contents of this file are not used.
The file_context module only reads the exterior metadata from the filesystem,
including:

	- file name
	- file stats (modification dates, permissions, etc)
	- directory path to the file
	- "sidecar" data files in YAML format for each level of directory
	  (these are treated as attributes of the directory they are contained in).
